Change Ideas:
	Take library out of namespace


New Feature Ideas:
	Create attributes class for functions to not require creating `Command` object

	Make disposable?

	Startup Message?

	Create CLI-HELP (or just in include in help)?
			Maybe all helps show CLIApplication v0.0.0 do CLI-HELP for more
		Shows all details of current Application and library
		shows syntax
		an about with versioning?
		shows application help tabbed, /\ not tabbed maybe?

	Ability to run an argument as a function if exists and allows
		create derived `Command` class
		`Command` class had property that identifies if derived class exists
		syntax 1? -> `command-name arg1 (command2-name cmd2arg1 cmd2arg2)`
		syntax 2? -> `command-name arg1 =>command2-name(cmd2arg1)`

	Better Arg/Kwarg
		Better argument parsing reverse itteration?
		creating GetArgument(position) -> searches for position then kwarg, kwarg takes priority.

	Commands have property for args and description seperate

	Option for defualt shell\underlying shell commands?

	Option for better help
		user-defined command named `help` overrides default
		non-overridable command default-help show the default help
